/*
Todo component sample pseudo code test:
Test 1:
I would render the Todo component and check that the text decoration style is set to none by default


Add a few more tests below that you think help verify the logic and expected behaviour. 
Do not over test.


Test 2: 
Render the Todo component with the 'text' prop and check that the component contains the text.

Test 3:
Render the Todo component with the 'completed' prop set to true and check that the text decoration style is set to 'line-through'.

Test 4:
Render the Todo component with an onClick function and check that it renders a clickable list item.
