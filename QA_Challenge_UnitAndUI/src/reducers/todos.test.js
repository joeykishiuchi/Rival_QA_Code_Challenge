/*
reducers sample pseudo code test:
Test 1:
I would pass in an undefined state and empty action as inputs and check that the output returns the initial state.


Add a few more tests below that you think help verify the logic and expected behaviour. 
Do not over test.

Test 2: 
Pass an empty state and a mock ADD_TODO action as inputs and check that the output returns a state with an array of length '1'.

Test 3:
Pass a TOGGLE_TODO action with the same 'id' as the previously added item and check that the output returns a todo item with a truthy 'completed' value.

Test 4: 
Pass a TOGGLE_TODO action with the same 'id' as the previously toggled item and check that the output returns a todo item with a falsy 'completed' value.
